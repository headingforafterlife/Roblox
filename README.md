# Welcome to My Roblox Scripts Repository

Hello and welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently learning Lua, and this repository contains various scripts, some of which I've written myself, and others that I've uploaded for personal use or experimentation.

## ðŸ“š About This Repository

- **Learning Lua:** As I am still in the process of learning Lua, some of the scripts may not be fully optimized or perfect. However, each script represents a step in my learning journey.
  
- **Not All Scripts Are Mine:** While many scripts are created by me, some are uploaded for personal use or testing. These scripts are not my original creations, but I find them useful for my projects and learning process.

- **Personal Use:** Many of the uploaded scripts are meant to help me experiment with different features of Lua. Feel free to explore, but please keep in mind that not all code may be ready for public use or may require improvements.
